------------------------------------------------
IVA model to deliver Car Make/Color/Type models out of deepstream environment with detector.
------------------------------------------------

The detector is a ssd-300 and not optmized using tensorrt and the rest of models are
optimized using tensorrt engine. Each modules are classes so that the deployement can be eased. 

Dependencies:
1. CUDA9.2 + Cudnn # kindly note that CUDA9.2 is a hard requirement.
2. TensorRT and pycuda for optimization 
3. TensorFlow
4. Keras
5. Opencv
6. Numpy

usage:

    python infer_iva.py -i input_image_path -o output_npy_path
